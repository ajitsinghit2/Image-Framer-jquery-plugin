# Image Framer jquery plugin

Image Framer is very simple jQuery plugin that wraps your images inside a frame. _Actually, despite the name, you can frame any element._


_Website is coming soon._ Currently you can find demo html files in the package.

## Freatures

* All of the frames are flexible to any pretty much any image size
* Comes with 24 frames
* All frames come in 4 different sizes
* 4 different inner shadows
* HTML 5 data-attributes can be used to overwrite the plugin options

## Usage instructions

* _Coming soon..._


## Tested browsers

* _Coming soon..._

## What's to come (maybe)?

* Moar frames!!!
* a psd file / script, that enables virtually anyone to make frames in a snap.
 * Currently I do have a file much like that to streamline my workflow to create the frames, but it's much too messy to be release to the wild ...and I used it with Slicy.
* I need to refine some of the frame files.
 * Quality
 * top-bottom and right-left images are unnecessary wide for some frame types.
 * I pretty much half-assed the way I named the frames, so it's not very consistent.
